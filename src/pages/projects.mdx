## String Date

[Github](https://github.com/92green/stringdate)

Do you find that most of the time dates and times are strings? You receive them through JSON as a string and you render them to the user as a string. If you are already using libraries to manipulate and format them, why bother dealing with the rubbish JavaScript Date object. Just use strings everywhere.

```js
import {add, format} from 'stringdate';
import {pipeWith} from 'unfunctional';

const tomorrow = pipeWith(
    '2020-01-01',
    add('P1D'),
    format('EEEE MMMM do yyyy')
);

// tomorrow === 'Thursday January 2nd 2020';
```
